# LAS Ion Optics 

This repo is for developing ion optics for the LAS at UCalgary.

In the "E&B in CF - Long 6way cross -  Einz - Pierce - 12th version- High energy beam" iob file, I changed the bender box voltage to the earth ground and as a result, at the input RFQ gate we could get energy in the order of 1.3 keV. Also, I had to change the bender electrodes' voltage in order to bend 90 degree.

In the "E&B in CF - Long 6way cross -  Einz - Pierce - 12th version- High energy beam at 5kV" iob file, I tried same as above but I multiplied all voltages by factor of 3. It seems it works pretty well.
